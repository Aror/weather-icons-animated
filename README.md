## Basic Usage

### Using an icon in your project:

Include in your index.html (or download separately):
* ```<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js"></script>```
* ```<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/1.19.0/TweenMax.min.js"></script>```

1. Copy the icon SVG from the index.html file.
2. Find and copy the corresponding CSS from the main.css file.
3. Copy the corresponding function from the script.js file. Remove the killAllAnimation(); function reference from the copied function.
